# Tailwind CSS learn

This project was built to get familiar with Tailwind CSS. The home page will list all my completed projects in the future. Since the main goal is to get familiar with Tailwind CSS, the following projects will not focus too many on JavaScript.

## Where are the corresponding files?

Each project has their own page file in `pages` folder, and the components file are placed in `components/{project-name}` folder. For example, if you want to find the corresponding files of `sunnyside-agency-landing-page`, the page file is `pages/sunnyside-agency-landing-page.tsx` and all the components files will be placed in `components/sunnyside-agency-landing-page` folder.
